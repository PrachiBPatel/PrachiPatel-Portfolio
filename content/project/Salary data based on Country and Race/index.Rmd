### Introduction

### Data Dictionary

### Import Library

This section loads and attaches all the necessary libraries for this project.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(reticulate)
```

```{python, include=FALSE}
# !pip install 
```

> Data Set Reference: Kaggle

### Importing Python Library

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
```

### Import Dataset

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv('Salary_Data_Based_country_and_race.csv')
```

### Read Dataset

```{python}
# It will return first few rows of the dataset.
df.head()
```

#### Database Information

```{python}
print('Total Rows:', df.shape[0])
print('Total Columns:', df.shape[1])
```

#### Dataset Details

```{python}
df.info()
```

As per the details mentioned above we can say that there are 9 columns and 6704 records.

Also, there are couple of null values and unnamed column available in the dataset.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's drop the unnamed column from the dataset.

```{python}
df.drop(columns=df.columns[0], axis=1,  inplace=True)
df.head()
```

Now let's check unique values available for each column and adjust if needed.

```{python}
df.select_dtypes(include='object').nunique()
```

```{python}
# Unique Job Title List
df['Job Title'].unique()
```

Now, let's change Job Title value from large segment to smaller unique values. So, it will be easy to analyze.

```{python}
def categorize_job_title(job_title):
    job_title = str(job_title).lower()  # Convert to lowercase for case-insensitivity
    if 'software' in job_title or 'developer' in job_title:
        return 'Software/Developer'
    elif 'data' in job_title or 'analyst' in job_title or 'scientist' in job_title:
        return 'Data/Analyst/Scientist'
    elif 'manager' in job_title or 'director' in job_title or 'vp' in job_title:
        return 'Manager/Director/VP'
    elif 'sales' in job_title or 'representative' in job_title:
        return 'Sales'
    elif 'marketing' in job_title or 'social media' in job_title:
        return 'Marketing/ Social Media'
    elif 'product' in job_title or 'designer' in job_title:
        return 'Product/Designer'
    elif 'hr' in job_title or 'human resources' in job_title:
        return 'HR/Human Resources'
    elif 'financial' in job_title or 'accountant' in job_title:
        return 'Financial/Accountant'
    elif 'project manager' in job_title:
        return 'Project Manager'
    elif 'it' in job_title or 'support' in job_title:
        return 'IT/Technical Support'
    elif 'operations' in job_title or 'supply chain'in job_title:
        return 'Operations/Supply Chain'
    elif 'cusotmer service' in job_title or 'receptionist' in job_title:
        return 'Customer Service/Receptionist'
    else:
        return 'Other'

df['Job Title'] = df['Job Title'].apply(categorize_job_title)
```


```{python}
#Unique values for Race field
df['Race'].unique()
```

```{python}
# Number of data for Race field.
df['Race'].value_counts()
```

Creating a new data frame to see the percentage of each race data in out database.

```{python}
# Calculate the percentage of each race
race_percentage = df['Race'].value_counts(normalize=True) * 100

# Convert the series to a DataFrame
race_percentage_df = race_percentage.reset_index()
race_percentage_df.columns = ['Race', 'Percentage']

# Display the DataFrame
race_percentage_df

```

Now, we will add the percentage(%) symbol into the percentage field.

First converted numeric datatype into the string.

After that, I have added the percentage(%) symbol into the percentage field.

```{python}
# Round the percentage values to two decimal places
race_percentage_df['Percentage'] = race_percentage_df['Percentage'].astype(float).round(2)

# Convert the percentage values to strings and add the percentage symbol
race_percentage_df['Percentage'] = race_percentage_df['Percentage'].astype(str) + '%'

# Display the DataFrame with the formatted percentage values
race_percentage_df
```

Making the Pie Plot for the race percentage data.

autopct='%.2f' is used to add the two decimal value in the field and add the percentage symbol into the Percentage Field.

y=0.94 is used to adjust the fine-tune the vertical alignment of the title.

```{python}
# Create a pie chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))  # Set the figure size
plt.pie(
    race_percentage,  # Data for the pie chart
    labels=race_percentage.index,  # Labels for each slice
    autopct='%.2f%%',  # Format the percentage values to two decimal places
    startangle=140  # Start angle for the first slice
)

# Add a title with vertical alignment fine-tuned
plt.title('Race Percentage Distribution', y=0.94)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

Salary distribution based on the Race.

Based on the box plot we can see that there is not much difference with the distribution of all race.

```{python}
# Create a box plot for salary distribution based on race
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.boxplot(x='Race', y='Salary', data=df)

# Add a title to the plot
plt.title('Salary Distribution Based on Race')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

**Mean of Salary based on Country**

Based on the graph we can say that there is not much difference in the salary based on each Country.

```{python}
# Calculate the mean salary for each country
mean_salary_by_country = df.groupby('Country')['Salary'].mean().reset_index()

# Rename the columns for clarity
mean_salary_by_country.columns = ['Country', 'Mean Salary']

# Sort the values by mean salary for better visualization
mean_salary_by_country = mean_salary_by_country.sort_values(by='Mean Salary')

# Create a bar plot for mean salary based on country
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
sns.barplot(x='Mean Salary', y='Country', data=mean_salary_by_country, palette='viridis')

# Add a title to the plot
plt.title('Mean Salary Based on Country')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```

**Mean of Salary based on Race field**

```{python}
df.groupby('Race')['Salary'].mean()
```

Bar Plot based on Race and Salary mean value.

plt.grid(axis='y') - this line is used to add the vertical line.

We must have to write this line after df.groupby.

Otherwise, this will not help to add the grid in the graph.

We can see that there is not much difference in the Salary based on Race.

```{python}
# Calculate the mean salary for each race
mean_salary_by_race = df.groupby('Race')['Salary'].mean().reset_index()

# Rename the columns for clarity
mean_salary_by_race.columns = ['Race', 'Mean Salary']

# Sort the values by mean salary for better visualization
mean_salary_by_race = mean_salary_by_race.sort_values(by='Mean Salary')

# Create a bar plot for mean salary based on race
plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
sns.barplot(x='Mean Salary', y='Race', data=mean_salary_by_race, palette='viridis')

# Add a title to the plot
plt.title('Mean Salary Based on Race')

# Add vertical grid lines
plt.grid(axis='x')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```

**Salary distribution based on Gender**

Here, `vert=False` is used to specify the boxes in horizontally figsize(12,7) is used to set the size of the figure.

Based on the box plot we can see that male gender have highest salary amount with the comparision of other gender.

```{python}
# Create a box plot for salary distribution based on gender
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))
sns.boxplot(x='Salary', y='Gender', data=df, orient='h')

# Add a title to the plot
plt.title('Salary Distribution Based on Gender')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```

**Mean of Salary based on Gender field**

Male gender salary amount is higher than other but there is not much difference between one another.

```{python}
# Calculate the mean salary for each gender
mean_salary_by_gender = df.groupby('Gender')['Salary'].mean().reset_index()

# Rename the columns for clarity
mean_salary_by_gender.columns = ['Gender', 'Mean Salary']

# Sort the values by mean salary for better visualization (optional)
mean_salary_by_gender = mean_salary_by_gender.sort_values(by='Mean Salary')

# Create a bar plot for mean salary based on gender
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Gender', y='Mean Salary', data=mean_salary_by_gender, palette='viridis')

# Add a title to the plot
plt.title('Mean Salary Based on Gender')

# Add vertical grid lines
plt.grid(axis='y')

# Display the plot
plt.show()

```

#### Conclusion

The analysis found that salaries are quite similar across different countries and races, showing no significant disparities. However, there is a slight difference in salaries based on gender, with males earning slightly more on average. Overall, the data suggests relative salary equality with some minor gender-based differences.
