This section is for the basic set up.
It will clear all the plots, the console and the workspace.
It also sets the overall format for numbers.

```{r}
if(!is.null(dev.list())) dev.off()
cat("\014") 
rm(list=ls())
options(scipen=9)
```

This section loads and attaches all the necessary packages.

```{r}
if(!require(readxl)){install.packages("readxl")}
library("readxl")

if(!require(pastecs)){install.packages("pastecs")}
library("pastecs")

if(!require(lattice)){install.packages("lattice")}

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
getwd()  # for verifying working directory
ExcelFile <- read.csv("PROG8430_Assign04_22F.txt")
ExcelFile <- as.data.frame(ExcelFile)
head(ExcelFile)

# 1. Preliminary and Exploratory
####################################

##  1. Rename all variables with your initials appended (just as was done in assignment 1,2 and 3)
  
```{r}
colnames(ExcelFile) <- paste(colnames(ExcelFile), "", sep = "")
head(ExcelFile)
```

##    2. Examine the data using the exploratory techniques we have learned in class. Does the data look reasonable? Are there any outliers? If so, deal with them appropriately. 

###     -> As per below boxplots and density plots for vintage of products, removing the outliers as value -10 is not making any cense for this field.
###       Also, removed the outliners for No. of Product Ordered data where value is marked as Zero
  
```{r}
#Checking the outliners for all the fields.

boxplot(ExcelFile$Del, horizontal=TRUE, col=c("#6bc9c2"), pch=20, main = "Time of Delivery - Box Plot")
densityplot( ~ ExcelFile$Del, pch=6,col=c("#6bc9c2"), xlab = "Time of Delivery")

boxplot(ExcelFile$Vin, horizontal=TRUE, col=c("#6bc9c2"), pch=20, main = "Vintage of Product - Box Plot")
densityplot( ~ ExcelFile$Vin, pch=6,col=c("#6bc9c2"), xlab = "Vintage of Product")

boxplot(ExcelFile$Pkg, horizontal=TRUE, col=c("#6bc9c2"), pch=20, main = "No. of Product Ordered - Box Plot")
densityplot( ~ ExcelFile$Pkg, pch=6,col=c("#6bc9c2"), xlab = "No. of Product Ordered")

boxplot(ExcelFile$Cst, horizontal=TRUE, col=c("#6bc9c2"), pch=20, main = "No. of Orders per Customer - Box Plot")
densityplot( ~ ExcelFile$Cst, pch=6,col=c("#6bc9c2"), xlab = "No. of Orders per Customer")

boxplot(ExcelFile$Mil, horizontal=TRUE, col=c("#6bc9c2"), pch=20, main = "Distance - Box Plot")
densityplot( ~ ExcelFile$Mil, pch=6,col=c("#6bc9c2"), xlab = "Distance")

#Removed the vintage of products fields outliers and showing the updated box plot and density plot.

nr <- which(ExcelFile$Vin <0)
ExcelFile <- ExcelFile[-c(nr),]

boxplot(ExcelFile$Vin, horizontal=TRUE, col=c("#e8bbfa"), pch=20, main = "Vintage of Product - Box Plot")
densityplot( ~ ExcelFile$Vin, pch=6,col=c("#e8bbfa"), xlab = "Vintage of Product")

#Removed the No. of Product Ordered data where value is marked as Zero. Because zero value will not help in the analysis of this data.

nr <- which(ExcelFile$Pkg <= 0)
ExcelFile <- ExcelFile[-c(nr),]

boxplot(ExcelFile$Pkg, horizontal=TRUE, col=c("#e8bbfa"), pch=20, main = "No. of Product Ordered - Box Plot")
densityplot( ~ ExcelFile$Pkg, pch=6,col=c("#e8bbfa"), xlab = "No. of Product Ordered")

```
  
  
##  3. Using an appropriate technique from class, determine if there is any evidence if one Carrier has faster delivery times than the other. Make sure you explain the approach you took and your conclusions.

###   -> For checking fastest delivery times than the other, we can check using comparision test. 
###       Based on the mean value we received using t-test, we can say that Fed Post carrier has faster delivery time than M-Press Delivery Carrier.
  
```{r}

# Based on QQ-Norm Plot, we can say that data is normally distributed.

qqnorm(ExcelFile$Del)
qqline(ExcelFile$Del)

# To check compare two mean values we have to check the 3 assumptions for t-test.

# 1. Data is independent.
# 2. Data is normally distributed. 
#      Using Shapiro Normality test - p-value; we can say that data is normally distributed as p-value is 0.1288 that is greater than 0.05.

shapiro.test(ExcelFile$Del)

bwplot(Del ~ Car, data = ExcelFile)

# 3. Variance is unknown.
#     Based on f-test p-value = 0.1454, we can say that variances are same.

Car.FTest <- var.test(Del ~ Car, data=ExcelFile)
Car.FTest

# Data met all the assumptions so that we are performing t-test to compare mean value.
#   Based on the mean value we received using t-test, we can say that Fed Post carrier has faster delivery time than M-Press Delivery Carrier.

Car.TTest <- t.test(Del ~ Car, data=ExcelFile)
Car.TTest

```
  
  
##  4. As demonstrated in class, split the data frame into a training and a test file. This should be a 80/20 split. For the set.seed(), use the last four digits of your student number. The training set will be used to build the following models and the test set will be used to validate them.
  

```{r, echo=FALSE}

# Added 0.8 value to split data in 80:20 ratio.
sr <- 0.8

# Finding the number of rows in the data.
n.row <- nrow(ExcelFile)

#Choose the rows for the training sample 

set.seed(3879)
training.rows <- sample(1:n.row, sr*n.row, replace=FALSE)

#Assign to the training sample database.

train <- subset(ExcelFile[training.rows,])

# Assign the balance to the Test sample database.

test <- subset(ExcelFile[-c(training.rows),])

```

# 2.  Simple Linear Regression
####################################

##  1. Correlations: Create both numeric and graphical correlations (as demonstrated in class) and comment on noteworthy correlations you observe. Are these surprising? Do they make sense?

###   -> Based on the numeric and graphical corelation values, we can say that Time for Delivery is corelated to the number of packages ordered as it's value is 0.54. Further away the corelation value is from zero means stronger relation between those two variables. For number of orders customer has made is also negatively corelated to the time for delivery as it's value is -0.58. 

```{r}

cor(train[,unlist(lapply(train, is.numeric))], method="spearman")

corrgram(train, order=TRUE, lower.panel=panel.shade,
         upper.panel=panel.pie, text.panel=panel.txt,
         main="Correlations")

lm.fit_Pkg <-lm(Del ~ Pkg, data = train)
plot(Del ~ Pkg, data = train, pch=20)
abline(lm.fit_Pkg, col="Red")

lm.fit_Vin <-lm(Del ~ Vin, data = train)
plot(Del ~ Vin, data = train, pch=20)
abline(lm.fit_Vin, col="Red")

lm.fit_Cst <-lm(Del ~ Cst, data = train)
plot(Del ~ Cst, data = train, pch=20)
abline(lm.fit_Cst, col="Red")

lm.fit_Mil <-lm(Del ~ Mil, data = train)
plot(Del ~ Mil, data = train, pch=20)
abline(lm.fit_Mil, col="Red")

```
  
  
##  2. Create a simple linear regression model using time for delivery as the dependent variable and number of packages as the independent. Create a scatter plot of the two variables and overlay the regression line.
  
###  -> Simple linear regression is used to predict outcome based one variable.In regression, the dependent variable is marked as Y and the independent variable is marked as X. 
###       Based on the regression line and plot, we can say that delivery is not dependent based on number of packages field.
  
```{r}

  lm.fit_Pkg <-lm(Del ~ Pkg, data = train)
  summary(lm.fit_Pkg)
  
  plot(Del ~ Pkg, data = train, pch=20)
  abline(lm.fit_Pkg, col="Red")

```
  
  
##  3. Create a simple linear regression model using time for delivery as the dependent variable and vintage of the product as the independent. Create a scatter plot of the two variables and overlay the regression line.

###   -> Based on the regression line and plot, we can say that delivery is not dependent based on vintage of the product field.
  
```{r}
lm.fit_Vin <-lm(Del ~ Vin, data = train)
summary(lm.fit_Vin)

plot(Del ~ Vin, data = train, pch=20)
abline(lm.fit_Vin, col="Red")

```
  
  
##  4. As demonstrated in class, compare the models (F-Stat,r2, RMSE for train and test, etc.) Which model is superior? Why?
  
###   -> Lower the RMSE better the model. Based on the RMSE values we can say that train model is better for no. of packeges per order data and test model is better for Vintage of product data. As both the models value is lower than other.


```{r}

############### Training Model###############

pred <- predict(lm.fit_Pkg, newdata=train)

RMSE_trn <- sqrt(mean((train$Del - pred)^2))
round(RMSE_trn,3)

pred <- predict(lm.fit_Vin, newdata=train)

RMSE_trn <- sqrt(mean((train$Del - pred)^2))
round(RMSE_trn,3)

############### Test Model###############

pred <- predict(lm.fit_Pkg, newdata=test)

RMSE_trn <- sqrt(mean((test$Del - pred)^2))
round(RMSE_trn,3)

pred <- predict(lm.fit_Vin, newdata=test)

RMSE_trn <- sqrt(mean((test$Del - pred)^2))
round(RMSE_trn,3)
```

# 4. Model Development â€“ Multivariate
####################################

##  As demonstrated in class, create two models, one using all the variables and the other using backward selection. For each model interpret and comment on the main measures we discussed in class (including RMSE for train and test). (Your commentary should be yours, not simply copied from my example).

###       Check F-Stat (P-Value) for significance. So, value is less tha 0.05 then model is better than random one. Over here p-value is closer to zero for both the models then it's better than choosing randomly.

###       Adjusted R-Squared value is can't be negatice.
###       -For train model adjusted r-squared value is 0.6084 meaning 60.84% variation in the output. 
###       -For test model adjusted r-squared value is 0.6078 meaning 60.78% variation in the output.
###           Higher the r-square better the model. So, based on r-squared value, we can say that train model is better than test model.

###       Residuals should be zero and symmetrical and it will used to calculate the difference between model's prediction and actual value.

###       T-test of coefficient is for checking if the value matches with corelation and for significance. If value is less than 0.5 then coefficient is non zero. and value is greater than 0.05 then coefficient is zero.

###       Estimated Coefficient. Normal value for this test is 0.05 but in both the model is near to zero.

###       Lower values of RMSE indicate better fit. For test model, RMSE value is 0.98 and train model RMSE value is indicated as 1.

# 5. Model Evaluation â€“ Verifying Assumptions - Multivariate
####################################

##  For both models created in Step 4, evaluate the main assumptions of regression (for example, Error terms mean of zero, constant variance and normally distributed, etc.)
  
```{r}
# Training Model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  
plot(full.model_Train)  
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  
plot(back.model_Train)  
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
# Test Model
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))  
plot(full.model_test)  
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))  

par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

par(mfrow = c(1, 1))

# Checking Residual vectors.
# Training Model
full.res_trn <- residuals(full.model_Train)
back.res_trn <- residuals(back.model_Train)

# Test Model
full.res_tst <- residuals(full.model_test)
back.res_tst <- residuals(back.model_test)


# Check Normality Numerical - Based on the shapiro normality test we can say that all the models' are normally distributed as p-value is greater than 0.05.
# Training Model
shapiro.test(full.res_trn)
shapiro.test(back.res_trn)
# Test Model

shapiro.test(full.res_tst)
shapiro.test(back.res_tst)

# Comparing the RMSE for both the models.
##  Lower the RMSE better the model. test model is better for both full and backward models as test model's value is lower with the comparision of backward model.

RMSE_full <- c(RMSE_trn_full,RMSE_tst_full)
round(RMSE_full,2)

RMSE_back <- c(RMSE_trn_back,RMSE_tst_back)
round(RMSE_back,2)
```

# 6. Final Recommendation - Multivariate
####################################

## Based on your preceding analysis, recommend which of the two models from step 4 should be used and why.

###     Based on all the points mentioned in the step 4, we can say that test model is better than train model as all values are better in the test model based with the comparision of train model.
